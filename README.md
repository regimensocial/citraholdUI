This is Citrahold PC, for Windows, macOS, and Linux(~)

Citrahold is a 3DS Homebrew App, a piece of software, and a web service which allows you to easily sync your saves between 3DSes and Emulators.

**I am thinking of remaking Citrahold PC in a different framework. Qt was great at the time, but it's hard for me to maintain this, especially with growing real-life commitments.**
